	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three things that I learned from reading material</h2>
	<p>
	The web is always changing, evolving from Web 1.0’s static, read only pages to Web 2.0’s social and interactive platforms, and now to Web 3.0’s intelligent and decentralized systems. Trends and tools rise and fade quickly, which reminds us that flexibility is essential; what feels normal today could be outdated tomorrow.<br><br>
	At the same time, strong foundations last. Skills like HTML, CSS, accessibility, and performance keep websites usable across generations, unlike short-lived hacks or frameworks that often create problems later. Focusing on fundamentals ensures projects remain stable and meaningful over time.<br><br>
	Finally, the web is not just technology, it is a cultural and social space shaped by ethics, creativity, and responsibility. Critical web design asks us to think about how digital tools affect people and society, combining technical skills with awareness of history, politics, and culture. Creativity can appear in many forms—games, memes, activism, or apps showing that anyone with diverse ideas and perspectives can design for the web.
