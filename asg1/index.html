	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three things that I learned from reading material</h2>
	<p>
	The web is always changing, evolving from Web 1.0’s static, read only pages to Web 2.0’s social and interactive platforms, and now to Web 3.0’s intelligent and decentralized systems. Trends and tools rise and fade quickly, remind me that flexibility is essential; what feels normal today could be outdated tomorrow.<br><br>
	At the same time, strong foundations last. Skills like HTML, CSS, accessibility, and performance keep websites usable across generations, unlike short-lived hacks or frameworks that often create problems later. Focusing on fundamentals ensures projects remain stable and meaningful over time.<br><br>
	Critical web design is about more than just making websites look nice. It looks at how technology affects our lives and uses design as a way to question and imagine new possibilities.<br>Instead of accepting things as they are, it pushes designers to ask tough questions, uncover hidden agendas in websites, and create experiences that are fair, easy to use, and thought provoking.<br>This approach mixes art, technology, and social issues, showing up in websites, apps, memes, or interactive projects that deal with topics like privacy, inequality, or power.<br>The first chapter explains this both in theory and in practice, giving historical and cultural context while also teaching hands on coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, plus design tools like Figma and GitHub.<br>By learning through creating, testing, and reflecting, I'm guided to make projects that are not only functional but also ethical, creative, and socially aware.

	<h2>My Semester Project</h2>
	<p>
	My semester project will be a website that combines design and storytelling to explore a contemporary social event. The site will use interactive narratives, visuals, and hyperlinks to guide users through multiple perspectives of the event, encouraging reflection on its cultural, emotional, and ethical dimensions. By blending creative design with critical storytelling, the project aims to show how the web can become a space for dialogue, awareness, and shared experience.
