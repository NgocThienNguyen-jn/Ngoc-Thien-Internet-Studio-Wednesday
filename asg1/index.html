	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three things that I learned from reading material</h2>
	<p>
		The evolution of the web teaches us three important lessons. First, the web is always in flux-technologies and frameworks rise and fade, but core principles like usability, openness, and accessibility remain essential, reminding us not to get locked into passing fads.<br><br>Second, design is never neutral but deeply political and social: every choice we make on the web shapes who controls information, how people interact, and whose voices are amplified, which means designers must remain conscious of power and ethics.<br><br>Finally, lasting and resilient work comes from grounding design in context and creativity tools and trends may change, but understanding history, culture, and the social implications of technology ensures that our work not only functions but also matters in shaping a better digital future
