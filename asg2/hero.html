      <p>Loki is a figure from Norse mythology, known as a trickster god. He’s clever, mischievous, and often causes trouble for the gods in Asgard. Unlike many other gods, Loki isn’t fully good or evil—sometimes he helps the gods, and other times he betrays them. He’s associated with magic, shape-shifting, and cunning plans. Loki is also the father of several famous mythical beings, including Fenrir the wolf, Jörmungandr the world serpent, and Hel, ruler of the underworld. In modern culture, he’s become widely popular through Marvel’s comics and movies, where he’s often portrayed as Thor’s brother and an anti-hero with charm and wit.</p>
